# Three Amigos

The three amigo is an informational site for the players of Orbus Reborn VR who  
are also apart of the Three Amigo Fellowship.

## Alternate purpose
This site was also built in order to practice spacing with the css tool flex box and the  
creation of a simple and clean code base.

## unused files
There are files in this code base that are not yet being used. They have been set up for future use after more  
information about the game has been recieved.

## Next Steps

1. Obtain more information about the mechanics in Orbus VR reborn to implement in unused components
2. Connect to database and create authentication for Fellowship members in order to allow them  
to create profiles.
